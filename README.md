#### Hello there 👋 my name is Razvan and I am freshly employed as a Junior Web Developer, after a brief spell of being an intern.

#### ⚡🔰 Although a newcomer, I have been dealing with computers and technologies for a long time. Ever since childhood I have had an interest in the way modern applications and platforms operate behind the scenes and how they bring everything to life. In many ways, I have cultivated this curiosity and have been tackling said areas both within my educational path, but also in my personal endeavours.

#### ⚡🎭 Some of my noteworthy traits are: orientation towards details, the solid work ethic and ambition, and the compromising nature. As suggested, I look into any issues that may arise with tenacity and determination, always being ready to switch the approaches as it may best fit the ultimate goal. I deem intellectual flexibility the most powerful tool the human mind should strive to use. 

#### ⚡🏆  Most of my experience is related to web-based front-end technologies, in particular Vanilla JS and related frameworks (React/Vue), but I am in the process of exploring and learning other paths and possibilities. During this time, I also managed to venture into other, tangential concepts – including but not limited to various types of databases, NodeJS, CSS and its derivatives (SASS/Bootstrap/Tailwind), the nature and functionalities of APIs, and more, assimilating some core and even advanced concepts.
